# Blitzed Out Copycat – Open-Source Kink Board Game Web App

This is an open-source, privacy-focused, turn-based multiplayer web app inspired by BlitzedOut.com.

## Key Features
- Turn-based board game using boardgame.io (handles rooms, turns, moves, sync)
- Customizable action tiles/cards (user-editable decks with intensity levels: mild/medium/intense)
- Private rooms with shareable links (anonymous play)
- Integrated webcam/video chat via WebRTC (P2P with simple-peer or PeerJS) for remote play/reactions
- Consent tools: Skip buttons, boundary presets, safe word pause
- Adult/kink theme: Prompts are consensual, exciting, user-customizable dares/challenges

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React 18+ (functional components, hooks), TypeScript, Vite/Tailwind optional
- Game Logic: boardgame.io (define games with moves like rollDice, movePawn, drawAction)
- Multiplayer Sync: boardgame.io server (Node.js)
- Video Chat: WebRTC with simple-peer (P2P mesh, signaling via boardgame.io sockets)
- Backend: Node.js/Express (lightweight, for lobby if needed)
- Storage: localStorage or optional Firebase/Supabase for saved boards (keep open-source)

## Core Principles
- Privacy first: No logging of actions/prompts, age-gate (18+ confirmation)
- Consent: Always include skip/options in UI for actions
- Open-Source: Clean, modular, commented code
- Performance: Lightweight, no heavy deps

Always think step-by-step: Plan changes, reference existing files, test mentally.
